# aws-ecs-workshop-copilot

Deploying ECS workshop microservices (UI and services) application using copilot.
The deployment consists of multi containers.

This tutorial is based on the [AWS ECS Workshop](Source: https://ecsworkshop.com/)
but revised to use the local Linux environment instead of the Cloud9 workspace
used in the workshop.

![Microservices application](/images/architecture.jpg)

**NOTE:** the above picture shows three Availability Zones (AZ) but by default
the `copilot init` creates only two private subnets (i.e., one in each AZs)
and two private also one in each AZs. Therefore, the UI will show the traffic
arrows moving between the two subnets only. 

## Prerequisite

- Setup AWS CLI v2; follow the instructions:
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

- Configure the AWS CLI default profile, as follow. The access key ID and secret
  should be from a user with AdministratorAccess permission.
```
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: <replace-with-access-key-id>
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <replace-with-access-key>
Default region name [None]: us-west-2
Default output format [None]: json
```
  The configurations are stored in:
  - `~/.aws/config` file:
```
[default]
region=us-west-2
```  
  
  - `~/.aws/credential` file
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <replace-with-access-key-id>
aws_secret_access_key = <replace-with-access-key>
```


## SETUP for this workshop

- Setup the local linux "Environment variables" in the `~/.bashrc` file as follow.
  Please adjust the preferred default region. 
```
$ echo "export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION='us-west-2' >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo "export AWS_REGION=\$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION" >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo "export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

- Validate the aws region has been setup
``` 
$ test -n "$AWS_REGION" && echo AWS_REGION is "$AWS_REGION" || echo AWS_REGION is not set
```

- Setup the local linux `~/.bash_profile` file as follow.
```
$ echo "export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}" | tee -a ~/.bash_profile
$ echo "export AWS_REGION=${AWS_REGION}" | tee -a ~/.bash_profile
$ aws configure get default.region
```

- SKIP NOTE: unlike for the Cloud9 environment, we do not need to create the role,
  because our setup is using the local linux `aws cli` that has been configured
  to use the user who has the AdministratorRole, as described above.
  Source: [Create the IAM Role and attach it to the Cloud9 instance](https://ecsworkshop.com/start_the_workshop/workspace/#create-the-iam-role-and-attach-it-to-the-cloud9-instance)

- SKIP NOTE: unlike for he Cloud9 environment, we do not need to setup the
  the `~/.aws/config` - `credential_source = Ec2InstanceMetadata` as instructed
  in the workshop
  Source: [Using credentials for Amazon EC2 instance metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-metadata.html)

- Clone the repo; 
  Source: [CLONE THE SERVICE REPOS](https://ecsworkshop.com/microservices/clone/)
  NOTE: the service repos are not included in this repo. The service folders
  contain files that were generated after cloning such as:
  - the `git hash` in the `code_hash.txt`
  - the `copilot` folder containing artifacts generated by copilot.   
```
$ cd <project_folder>/aws-ecs-workshop
$ git clone https://github.com/aws-containers/ecsdemo-platform
$ git clone https://github.com/aws-containers/ecsdemo-frontend
$ git clone https://github.com/aws-containers/ecsdemo-nodejs
$ git clone https://github.com/aws-containers/ecsdemo-crystal
```

- Platform - Build the Platform; we are using copilot, so the platform resources
  will be created automatically by copilot. This will be done during deployment
  of the `ecsdemo-frontend` below when we issue `copilot init`  

- Platform - BUILD THE ENVIRONMENTS. Ensure service linked roles exist for 
  Load Balancers as follow. Alternatively, check using the aws console by 
  go to "IAM > Roles" page, filter the role "AWSServiceRoleForElasticLoadBalancing"
```
$ aws iam get-role --role-name "AWSServiceRoleForElasticLoadBalancing" 
```
  - If the role does not exist, create it:
  ```
  $ aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name "elasticloadbalancing.amazonaws.com"
  ```
  - Note, if the role already exists and you run the command to create it again
    an error will occur
  ```
  $ aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name "elasticloadbalancing.amazonaws.com"

  An error occurred (InvalidInput) when calling the CreateServiceLinkedRole operation: Service role name AWSServiceRoleForElasticLoadBalancing has been taken in this account, please try a different suffix.
  ```

- Platform - BUILD THE ENVIRONMENTS. Ensure service linked roles exist for ECS:
```
$ aws iam get-role --role-name "AWSServiceRoleForECS"
```
  - otherwise, create it
  ```
  $ aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name "ecs.amazonaws.com"
  ```  

- Platform - BUILD THE ENVIRONMENTS. Install the session manager plugin;
```
# For RHEL OS
curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/linux_64bit/session-manager-plugin.rpm" -o "session-manager-plugin.rpm"
sudo yum install -y session-manager-plugin.rpm
session-manager-plugin

# For Ubuntu
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html#install-plugin-linux
$ curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/ubuntu_64bit/session-manager-plugin.deb" -o "session-manager-plugin.deb"
$ sudo dpkg -i session-manager-plugin.deb
```
  - Verify the session-manager-plugin was installed.
```
$ session-manager-plugin
The Session Manager plugin is installed successfully. Use the AWS CLI to start a session.
$
```

## DEPLOY

### DEPLOY FRONTEND RAILS APP

Since we are deploying the first container, copilot will create the 
"copilot application", and the corresponding platform resources.

**Note:** we are not using any artifacts from the "ecsdemo-platform" repo.
The repo contains "aws cdk" codes for building platform resources that is 
generated by the copilot automatically during `copilot init` performed below.

- **Initialize** copilot application
```
$ cd <project_folder>/aws-ecs-workshop/ecsdemo-frontend
$ copilot init
Welcome to the Copilot CLI! We're going to walk you through some questions
to help you get set up with a containerized application on AWS. An application is a collection of
containerized services that operate together.

Application name: ecsworkshop
Workload type: Load Balanced Web Service
Service name: ecsdemo-frontend
Dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
Ok great, we'll set up a Load Balanced Web Service named ecsdemo-frontend in application ecsworkshop listening on port 3000.

- Next, the application presents the git hash to show the version of the 
  application that is deployed.
```
$ git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD > code_hash.txt
```

- We’re now ready to deploy our environment; the repo contains precreated
  folder & manifest. 
```
$ copilot env init --name test --profile default --default-config
It seems like you are trying to init an environment that already exists.
To generate a manifest for the environment:
1. `mkdir -p copilot/environments/test`
2. `copilot env show -n test --manifest > copilot/environments/test/manifest.yml`

Alternatively, to recreate the environment:
1. `copilot env delete --name test`
2. And then `copilot env init --name test`
✘ environment test already exists
```

- **DEPLOY** our service
```
$ copilot svc deploy

### Deploy the Nodejs backend service

We are now deploying the Nodejs backend service to the same platform 
infrastructure, or "copilot application" as the "ecsdemo-frontend".

- **Initialize** copilot application, but using the same application created 
  above during deployment of "ecsdemo-frontend": 
```
$ cd <project_folder>/aws-ecs-workshop/ecsdemo-nodejs
$ git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD
05f1957
$ git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD > code_hash.txt
$ copilot init
Welcome to the Copilot CLI! We're going to walk you through some questions
to help you get set up with a containerized application on AWS. An application is a collection of
containerized services that operate together.

Use existing application: Yes
Application name: ecsworkshop
Workload type: Backend Service
Service name: ecsdemo-nodejs
Dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
Ok great, we'll set up a Backend Service named ecsdemo-nodejs in application ecsworkshop listening on port 3000.

✔ Proposing infrastructure changes for stack ecsworkshop-infrastructure-roles
✔ The directory copilot will hold service manifests for application ecsworkshop.

✔ Wrote the manifest for service ecsdemo-nodejs at copilot/ecsdemo-nodejs/manifest.yml
Your manifest contains configurations like your container size and port (:3000).

- Update regional resources with stack set "ecsworkshop-infrastructure"  [succeeded]        [22.4s]
  - Update resources in region "us-west-2"                               [update complete]  [11.7s]
    - ECR container image repository for "ecsdemo-nodejs"                [create complete]  [2.6s]
All right, you're all set for local development.
Deploy: Yes

✔ Wrote the manifest for environment test at copilot/environments/test/manifest.yml
- Update regional resources with stack set "ecsworkshop-infrastructure"  [succeeded]  [9.4s]
✔ Proposing infrastructure changes for the ecsworkshop-test environment.
✔ Provisioned bootstrap resources for environment test in region us-west-2 under application ecsworkshop.
✔ Provisioned bootstrap resources for environment test.
✔ Proposing infrastructure changes for the ecsworkshop-test environment.
✘ Your update does not introduce immediate resource changes. 
This may be because the resources are not created until they are deemed 
necessary by a service deployment.

In this case, you can run `copilot env deploy --force` to push a modified template, even if there are no immediate changes.

### Deploy the crystal backend service

- **Initialize** copilot application, but using the same application infrastructure,
  or "copilot application" as the "ecsdemo-frontend". 
```
$ cd <project_folder>/aws-ecs-workshop/ecsdemo-crystal
$ git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD
b6db623
$ git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD > code_hash.txt
$ copilot init
Welcome to the Copilot CLI! We're going to walk you through some questions
to help you get set up with a containerized application on AWS. An application is a collection of
containerized services that operate together.

Use existing application: Yes
Application name: ecsworkshop
Workload type: Backend Service
Service name: ecsdemo-crystal
Dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
Ok great, we'll set up a Backend Service named ecsdemo-crystal in application ecsworkshop listening on port 3000.

✔ Proposing infrastructure changes for stack ecsworkshop-infrastructure-roles
✔ The directory copilot will hold service manifests for application ecsworkshop.

✔ Wrote the manifest for service ecsdemo-crystal at copilot/ecsdemo-crystal/manifest.yml
Your manifest contains configurations like your container size and port (:3000).

- Update regional resources with stack set "ecsworkshop-infrastructure"  [succeeded]        [22.3s]
  - Update resources in region "us-west-2"                               [update complete]  [11.6s]
    - ECR container image repository for "ecsdemo-crystal"               [create complete]  [2.5s]
All right, you're all set for local development.
Deploy: Yes

✔ Wrote the manifest for environment test at copilot/environments/test/manifest.yml
- Update regional resources with stack set "ecsworkshop-infrastructure"  [succeeded]  [9.2s]
✔ Proposing infrastructure changes for the ecsworkshop-test environment.
✔ Provisioned bootstrap resources for environment test in region us-west-2 under application ecsworkshop.
✔ Provisioned bootstrap resources for environment test.
✔ Proposing infrastructure changes for the ecsworkshop-test environment.
✘ Your update does not introduce immediate resource changes. 
This may be because the resources are not created until they are deemed 
necessary by a service deployment.
